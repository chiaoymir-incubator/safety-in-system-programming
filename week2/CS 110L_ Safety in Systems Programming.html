    <h1>Week 2 Exercises: Ownership and structs</h1>

    <p>Congratulations on making it to week 2! You rock!</p>
<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
<p>This week’s exercises will continue easing you into Rust. You’ll get some
practice with handling ownership/references and working with <code>Option</code> and
<code>Result</code>, and you’ll also get some light exposure to object-oriented
programming in Rust! The primary exercise involves implementing a simple
version of the <code>diff</code> utility to compare two files. Optionally, you can also
implement the <code>wc</code> (word count) utility, or try out some graphics and implement
Conway’s Game of Life.</p>
<p>Let’s build some practical tools, shall we?</p>
<p><strong>Due date:</strong> Tuesday, April 21, 11:59pm (Pacific time)</p>
<p><em>Ping us on Slack if you are having difficulty with this assignment. We would
love to help clarify any misunderstandings, and we want you to sleep!</em></p>
<h2 id="getting-the-code">Getting the code</h2>
<p>The starter code is available on GitHub
<a href="https://github.com/reberhardt7/cs110l-spr-2020-starter-code">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="part-1-ownership-short-answer-exercises">Part 1: Ownership short-answer exercises</h2>
<p>Let’s warm up with some short-answer questions to get you thinking about
ownership. For each of the following examples answer: Does this code compile?
Explain why or why not. If it doesn’t compile, what could you change to make it
compile? (If you’re not sure, you can run the compiler and try things out, but
you need to provide a high-level English explanation of why it does/doesn’t
work.)</p>

<h2 id="part-2-rdiff">Part 2: rdiff</h2>
<p>In this exercise, we will implement a simple version of the <code>diff</code> command-line
utility to compare two files. (When you’re finished, try using your tool to
check your CS 110 assignments’ output against the sample solution! It’s pretty
handy!)</p>
<p>Finding the diff between two files is a well-studied problem. Most
implementations use Myers’ algorithm, but in this exercise, we will have you
compute the longest common subsequence between the two files and use that
information to compute your diff. (LCS actually serves as the basis for Myers’
algorithm!)</p>
<p>We have split this program into milestones in order to make it easier to
implement and debug.</p>
<h3 id="milestone-1-reading-the-two-files-into-vectors-of-lines">Milestone 1: Reading the two files into vectors of lines</h3>
<p>In this milestone, you should edit main.rs and implement the function
<code>read_file_lines</code>, which takes a path to a file and returns a vector of lines
in the file.</p>
<p>If you are starting this before Thursday’s lecture, you may want to take a
quick look at <a href="https://reberhardt.com/cs110l/spring-2020/lecture-notes/lecture-03/#handling-errors">Tuesday’s lecture
notes</a> to familiarize yourself
with the ideas of <code>panic</code> and <code>Result</code>. This milestone will help you
familiarize yourself with these concepts.</p>
<p>First, you’ll need to open the file by calling <code>File::open(filename)</code>.
<code>File::open</code> returns a <code>Result</code>, since opening the file may fail (e.g. if the
filename is invalid).</p>
<p>You could open the file like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#f0f0f0;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span style="color:#007020;font-weight:bold">let</span><span style="color:#bbb"> </span>file<span style="color:#bbb"> </span><span style="color:#666">=</span><span style="color:#bbb"> </span>File::open(filename).unwrap();<span style="color:#bbb">
</span></code></pre></div><p>However, it’s generally good style to avoid calling <code>unwrap</code> or <code>expect</code> unless
the error absolutely should never occur, or unless you’re writing the code in
<code>main</code> or some other high-level function that won’t be reused in your program.
If you use <code>unwrap</code> or <code>expect</code> in helper functions, then code might use those
helper functions without realizing they could cause panics.</p>
<p>The idiomatic way to deal with this is to write something like the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#f0f0f0;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span style="color:#007020;font-weight:bold">let</span><span style="color:#bbb"> </span>file<span style="color:#bbb"> </span><span style="color:#666">=</span><span style="color:#bbb"> </span>File::open(filename)<span style="color:#666">?</span>;<span style="color:#bbb">
</span></code></pre></div><p>The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/error-handling-and-panics/the-question-mark-operator-for-easier-error-handling.html"><code>?</code>
operator</a>
is commonly used in Rust to propagate errors without having to repeatedly write
a lot of code to check a <code>Result</code>. That line of code really expands to this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#f0f0f0;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span style="color:#007020;font-weight:bold">let</span><span style="color:#bbb"> </span>file<span style="color:#bbb"> </span><span style="color:#666">=</span><span style="color:#bbb"> </span><span style="color:#007020;font-weight:bold">match</span><span style="color:#bbb"> </span>File::open(filename)<span style="color:#bbb"> </span>{<span style="color:#bbb">
</span><span style="color:#bbb">    </span><span style="color:#007020">Ok</span>(file)<span style="color:#bbb"> </span><span style="color:#666">=&gt;</span><span style="color:#bbb"> </span>file,<span style="color:#bbb">
</span><span style="color:#bbb">    </span><span style="color:#007020">Err</span>(err)<span style="color:#bbb"> </span><span style="color:#666">=&gt;</span><span style="color:#bbb"> </span><span style="color:#007020;font-weight:bold">return</span><span style="color:#bbb"> </span><span style="color:#007020">Err</span>(err),<span style="color:#bbb">
</span><span style="color:#bbb"></span>};<span style="color:#bbb">
</span></code></pre></div><p>If the <code>Result</code> was <code>Ok</code>, then the <code>?</code> gives you the returned value, but if the
result was an <code>Err</code>, it causes your function to return that <code>Err</code> (propagating
the error through the call chain).</p>
<p>Once you have your file open, you can read the lines like so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#f0f0f0;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span style="color:#007020;font-weight:bold">for</span><span style="color:#bbb"> </span>line<span style="color:#bbb"> </span><span style="color:#007020;font-weight:bold">in</span><span style="color:#bbb"> </span>io::BufReader::new(file).lines()<span style="color:#bbb"> </span>{<span style="color:#bbb">
</span><span style="color:#bbb">    </span><span style="color:#007020;font-weight:bold">let</span><span style="color:#bbb"> </span>line_str<span style="color:#bbb"> </span><span style="color:#666">=</span><span style="color:#bbb"> </span>line<span style="color:#666">?</span>;<span style="color:#bbb">
</span><span style="color:#bbb">    </span><span style="color:#60a0b0;font-style:italic">// do something with line_str
</span><span style="color:#60a0b0;font-style:italic"></span>}<span style="color:#bbb">
</span></code></pre></div><p>In this code, <code>line</code> is a <code>Result&lt;String, io::Error&gt;</code>. We can safely unwrap its
<code>Ok</code> value using <code>?</code>, as we did when opening the file. Then, you can add the
string to a vector.</p>
<p>Finish implementing <code>read_file_lines</code>. Then, test your implementation by
running <code>cargo test test_read_file_lines</code>. (The test definition is at the
bottom of the file if you want to look at it.)</p>
<p>If you would like to print a vector for debugging purposes, you can do so as
follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#f0f0f0;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span style="color:#007020;font-weight:bold">let</span><span style="color:#bbb"> </span>v<span style="color:#bbb"> </span><span style="color:#666">=</span><span style="color:#bbb"> </span>vec<span style="color:#666">!</span>[<span style="color:#40a070">1</span>,<span style="color:#bbb"> </span><span style="color:#40a070">2</span>,<span style="color:#bbb"> </span><span style="color:#40a070">3</span>];<span style="color:#bbb">
</span><span style="color:#bbb"></span>println<span style="color:#666">!</span>(<span style="color:#4070a0">"{:?}"</span>,<span style="color:#bbb"> </span>v);<span style="color:#bbb">
</span></code></pre></div><h3 id="milestone-2-implementing-the-grid-interface">Milestone 2: Implementing the Grid interface</h3>
<p>To make this problem easier to solve, we are going to introduce a <code>Grid</code>
struct, which internally stores data as a flat vector. In this milestone, you
will implement two small methods on this struct.</p>
<p>Open <code>grid.rs</code> and have a look at the code that is already there. The <code>new</code>
function initializes a vector with enough space to store <code>num_rows * num_cols</code>
elements. The <code>display</code> function prints out the contents of the <code>Grid</code>, and the
<code>clear</code> function zeroes all the elements.</p>
<p>Your job is to implement the <code>get</code> and <code>set</code> functions. <code>get</code> should return
<code>Some(value)</code> if the provided location is within bounds, and <code>None</code> if it is
out of bounds. <code>set</code> should return <code>Ok(())</code> (<code>()</code> is the “void type” in Rust,
indicating “nothing to return”) on success, or <code>Err(some error message)</code> if the
provided location is out of bounds.</p>
<p>You’ll need to come up some mapping from 2D <code>Grid</code> locations to 1D <code>Vec</code>
locations. Accessing struct members uses syntax similar to Python; for example,
to get the number of rows, you would write <code>self.num_rows</code>.</p>
<p>To test your code, run <code>cargo test test_grid -- --nocapture</code>.</p>
<h3 id="milestone-3-implementing-longest-common-subsequence">Milestone 3: Implementing Longest Common Subsequence</h3>
<p>Longest Common Subsequence is a common algorithms problem: given two sequences,
what is the longest <em>subsequence</em> that appears in both? In the character
sequence “a b c d” and “a d b c”, the longest common subsequence is “a b c”,
because those characters appear in order in both “a b c d " and “a d b c”.
(Note that a subsequence needn’t be consecutive, but it does need to be in
order.)</p>
<p>When diffing two files, we want to determine which lines were added or removed
between them. To do this, we need to identify the lines that are common between
both files. We can frame this as an LCS problem! We have two sequences of
<em>lines</em>, and we want to find the longest subsequence of lines that appears in
both files; those lines are the lines that were unmodified, and the other lines
are those that were added or removed.</p>
<p>LCS is generally solved using dynamic programming. If you have taken CS 161,
you may have seen this problem before. Wikipedia has an explanation
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem">here</a>, and
there is a decent YouTube video explaining the solution
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnD96abizww">here</a>. The solution involves
filling out a <code>Grid</code> with subsequence lengths. However, you really don’t need
to understand how the algorithm works for our purposes, as long as you can
implement the pseudocode below (adapted from Wikipedia).</p>
<pre><code>let X and Y be sequences
let m be the length of X, and let n be the length of Y

C = grid(m+1, n+1)
// here, the .., like in Rust, is inclusive on the left bound and exclusive on
// the right bound
for i := 0..m+1
    C[i,0] = 0
for j := 0..n+1
    C[0,j] = 0
for i := 0..m
    for j := 0..n
        if X[i] = Y[j]
            C[i+1,j+1] := C[i,j] + 1
        else
            C[i+1,j+1] := max(C[i+1,j], C[i,j+1])

return C
</code></pre><p>You should implement this algorithm in <code>lcs</code> in <code>main.rs</code>. (Feel free to use
better variable names in your code, as this is only pseudocode.) You can test
your implementation by running <code>cargo test test_lcs -- --nocapture</code>.</p>
<h3 id="milestone-4-using-lcs-to-construct-the-full-diff">Milestone 4: Using LCS to construct the full diff</h3>
<p>Time to put everything together! In the <code>main</code> function, you’ll need to do the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Call your <code>read_file_lines</code> function to read the contents of the two files.
You’ll want to call <code>expect</code> here with a suitable error message to handle the
case where one of the supplied filenames is invalid.</li>
<li>Call <code>lcs</code> to get an LCS <code>Grid</code>.</li>
<li>Implement and call the following pseudocode (adapted from Wikipedia) to print
the diff:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>* let C be the grid computed by lcs()
* let X and Y be sequences
* i and j specify a location within C that you want to look at when reading out
  the diff. (This makes more sense if you understand the LCS algorithm, but
  it's not important.) When you call this function initially, just pass
  i=len(X) and j=len(Y).
function print_diff(C, X, Y, i, j)
    if i &gt; 0 and j &gt; 0 and X[i-1] = Y[j-1]
        print_diff(C, X, Y, i-1, j-1)
        print "  " + X[i-1]
    else if j &gt; 0 and (i = 0 or C[i,j-1] ≥ C[i-1,j])
        print_diff(C, X, Y, i, j-1)
        print "&gt; " + Y[j-1]
    else if i &gt; 0 and (j = 0 or C[i,j-1] &lt; C[i-1,j])
        print_diff(C, X, Y, i-1, j)
        print "&lt; " + X[i-1]
    else
        print ""
</code></pre><p>Notice that Wikipedia’s solution is recursive. This is not optimal, since the
compiler is not guaranteed to optimize this recursion away. This means you
could quickly run out of stack space if the files are large.  If you’re up for
an extra challenge, see if you can figure out a way to convert this recursive
defintion into an iterative one (although you’re certainly not required to do
this).</p>
<p>You can run your program like so:</p>
<pre><code>cargo run simple-a.txt simple-b.txt
</code></pre><p>You should get the following output:</p>
<pre><code>  a
&gt; added
  b
  c
&gt; added
  d
&gt; added
  e
</code></pre><p>You should also try on something slightly more complex:</p>
<pre><code>cargo run handout-a.txt handout-b.txt
</code></pre><p>You should see this output:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; You'll be learning and practicing a lot of new Rust concepts this week by
&lt; This week's exercises will continue easing you into Rust and will feature some
&lt; components of object-oriented Rust that we're covering this week. You'll be
  writing some programs that have more sophisticated logic that what you saw last
  with last week's exercises. The first exercise is a warm-up: to implement the wc
  command line utility in Rust. The second exercise is more challenging: to
  implement the diff utility. In order to do so, you'll first find the longest
&gt; subsequence that is common.
&lt; common subsequence (LCS) of lines between the two files and use this to inform
&lt; how you display your diff.
</code></pre><p>It’s fine if the <code>&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;</code> lines are printed in a different order, as long as
the diff is valid.</p>
<p>Congratulations! You have a mini version of <code>diff</code> working in Rust!</p>
<h2 id="optional-rwc">Optional: rwc</h2>
<p>If you’ve made it this far and still have some time left over, give this next
small program a try! It’s smaller and easier than <code>rdiff</code>, but will give you
more great practice.</p>
<p>Implement the most basic form of the <code>wc</code> command – given an input file,
output the number of words, lines, and characters in the file. There is some
minimal starter code in <code>rwc/src/main.rs</code>!</p>
<h2 id="optional-challenge-conways-game-of-life">Optional challenge: Conway’s Game of Life</h2>
<p>Haven’t had enough Rust for the week? Well this exercise is for you!</p>
<p>Implement a Conway’s Game of Life animation in Rust! Provide a way for the user
to specify what cells are on at the start, to start/stop the animation, specify
the speed of the animation, and run the animation for a certain number of steps.
You might be interested in using <a href="https://guide.nannou.cc/tutorials.html">this GUI library</a>
You should consider using your Grid type from the rdiff portion (we haven’t
talked about generics in Rust yet, but you can extend your implementation with
generics if you feel inclined to look into them!).</p>
<p>This exercise will give you experience using other people’s crates.</p>
<p>Be sure to run <code>git add .</code> before committing in order to make sure that any new
files you’ve created get included in your submission.</p>
